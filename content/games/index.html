<p>Experimental Gameplay Project</p>
<br />
<p>The <a href="http://experimentalgameplay.com/">Experimental Gameplay Project</a> is Iron Chef for indie game designers. Given a monthly theme, you have 7 days to make a game. The development cycle is short, so you can try out risky experimental ideas without a big investment in time. Plus, it's a really fun challenge to write a game in a week.</p>
